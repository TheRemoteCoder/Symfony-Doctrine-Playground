## Q+A

### Symfony

- [ ] Why do -some- classes need constructor() import and others not?
  - e.g. Factory/Repository classes
  - Service container autowiring?
- [ ] Entities: Why nullable types, despite telling in CLI generatator that it should NOT be null?
  - Example: `public function getId(): ?int`
- [ ] .gitignore: Why so many of them e.g. in Entities, Migrations, translations, ...?
  - Instead of: .gitkeep?

### Development

- [ ] VSCode: ORM annotations don't have IntelliSense - Possible? How to fix?
  - e.g. `@ORM\GeneratedValue` is not clickable to see details?
